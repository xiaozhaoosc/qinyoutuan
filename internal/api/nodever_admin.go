// namespace. The script installs to /usr/local/bin/sing-box, so clicking 重装
// for 面板本机 could only ever fail with EROFS, while the very same script run
// from a root shell on that machine succeeds. Nothing about the error said so:
// `install` reports "Read-only file system" for a disk that is writable.
//
// systemd-run asks PID1 to start a transient unit, which is created fresh from
// PID1's namespace and so sees /usr writable again. --pipe passes our stdin
// (the script) in and the output back, --wait blocks until it exits and
// propagates its status, --collect reaps the unit even when it fails. All four
// flags predate systemd 236; --service-type=exec is deliberately not used, as
// it needs 240.

// systemd-run — which is what the job's timeout does — does not stop the unit
// it asked PID1 to start. A fixed name makes the next click refuse to start a
