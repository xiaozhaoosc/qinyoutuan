// BackupTo writes a consistent snapshot of the whole database to dst.
//
// This exists because the obvious thing — copying qinyoutuan.db — is wrong here.
// The database runs in WAL mode, so at any moment an arbitrary amount of
// committed data lives in the -wal file and not in the main file at all. A copy
// of qinyoutuan.db alone is a torn, stale database; a copy of all three files
// taken while a write is in flight is worse, because it looks intact and only
// fails later. Restoring either one loses orders, traffic counters, or the
// certificate table, and the operator finds out at the moment they can least
// afford to.
//
// VACUUM INTO takes the snapshot from inside SQLite: it runs against a read
// transaction, so it sees exactly one committed point in time, includes
// everything in the WAL, and produces a single self-contained file with no
// sidecars. Readers and writers keep working while it runs.
//
// dst must not already exist — SQLite refuses to overwrite, and we surface that
// rather than deleting whatever is in the way.
